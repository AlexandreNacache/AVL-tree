# AVL-tree

Welcome to AVL tree.

AVL stands for Adelson-Velskii Landis trees. 
AVL trees are self balancing BST (Binary Search Trees).
BST are trees such that every node has at most 2 childs, and every value on the left of a node is smaller than the values on the right of that node. In other words, it is an ordered tree.
AVL trees are BST's that self balances. Below is the definition of a balanced tree.

A tree is balanced if for each node of the tree, these 3 conditions are true:

The left and right subtrees' heights differ by at most one, AND
The left subtree is balanced, AND
The right subtree is balanced.
